Layers and Services
1. Bronze Layer
Events.py: Handles event logging and processing at the raw data ingestion stage. This file manages the first point of data collection, ensuring that incoming data is properly captured and formatted for further processing.
Init.py: Contains initialization procedures and setup for the Bronze Layer, including environment configuration and initial data checks.
2. Silver Layer
Scraped.py: This script processes data that has been scraped from various sources. The data is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for the next stage.
Silver.py: Contains the logic for transforming the processed data into a structured format, ready for more advanced analytics or storage in a database.
3. Gold Layer
Gold.py: This layer involves advanced transformations and feature engineering on the processed data. It prepares the data for machine learning models or detailed business analytics.
4. Platinum Layer
Platinum.py: The final layer where the most refined data products are generated. This layer may involve complex aggregations, joins, and calculations, ready for use in high-stakes decision-making processes.
5. Raw Layer
batch
Raw data Ingestation (Lambda Service).py: A Lambda service designed to ingest raw data in batch mode. It manages the extraction and initial transformation of large datasets before they enter the Bronze Layer.
downloader
app.py: A service responsible for downloading raw data from external sources. This script is likely integrated with cloud storage services or APIs to pull in fresh data.
requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required by the downloader service.
zip_processor
app.py: Processes ZIP files, extracting and preparing the data contained within them for further processing in subsequent layers.
6. Scraping Service
app.py: Manages web scraping tasks, gathering data from specified URLs or APIs. The scraped data is passed to the Silver Layer for processing.
requirements.txt: Specifies the dependencies needed for the scraping service, ensuring that all necessary libraries are installed.
7. Data Governance
Governance.py: Implements data governance policies, ensuring that data is managed according to the organization's standards. This includes data quality checks, compliance with data privacy regulations, and ensuring data lineage and auditability.
8. URLs Availability
Insert Messages.py: Handles the insertion of messages or URLs into a queue or database. This is likely used in conjunction with the scraping or raw ingestion processes.
get_url
app.py: A service that retrieves URLs from a queue or database for processing.
post_url
app.py: A service that posts or updates URLs in a queue or database after processing.
Additional Notes
Each layer and service has a clear responsibility within the data pipeline, ensuring that data is systematically processed from raw ingestion to refined data products.
The structure allows for easy scaling and maintenance of individual components without disrupting the entire pipeline.
